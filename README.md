# Comparing Graph Embeddings

We propose a framework to compare the quality of graph embeddings obtained with
different algorithms and/or different choices of parameters. To that effect, we
use a new divergence score based on a generalization of the well-know Chung-Lu
random graph model.

This repository contains the code and some examples for computing the divergence scores
for two versions of our framework (1) the original version, which is suitable for graphs
with thousands of vertices, and (2) a scalable, landmark-based version, which should be used
on graphs with millions of vertices.

# Compiling and Running the Original Framework 

GED (Graph Embedding Divergence)

This code computes the Jenssen-Shannon divergence between two edge distributions:  
(1) first one is based on the supplied graph clustering  
(2) second one is based on the supplied embedding and a Geometric Chung-Lu model  
When comparing embeddings, lower divergence is better.

To compile:

```
gcc GED.c -o GED -lm -O3
```

Format:

```
./GED -g edgelist_file -c clusters_file -e embedding_file [-a max_alpha -s epsilon_step -d delta -v]

## required flags:
-g: the edgelist (1 per line, whitespace separated, no weights)
-c: the communities (in vertex order, 1 per line)
-e: the embedding (node2vec format)
## optional flags:
-a: maximum value of alpha to consider (default 10.0)
-s: epsilon step (default 0.01)
-d: delta, stopping criterion (default 0.001)
-v: verbose 
```

# Running with supplied data

The embeddings can be visualized in the supplied notebook.  

The embeddings were obtained with the node2vec, Verse and LINE algorithms (references below)  
We do not explicitely identify which embedding come from which algorithm, as this is not 
intended as a comparison study of those algorithms, just an illustration of the framework.

The clusterings were obtained with the ECG algorithm (reference below).  
The code can be found here: https://github.com/ftheberge/Ensemble-Clustering-for-Graphs

# File Formats

For a graph with n nodes, the nodes can be represented with numbers 1 to n or 0 to n-1.  

Three input files are required to run GED:  
1. the undirected, unweighted graph, represented by a sequence of edges, 1 per line  
2. a file with the node's cluster number, 1 per line, in numerical order of the nodes  
3. the node embedding in the node2vec format (see below)

## Example of graph (edgelist) file

Nodes can be 0-based or 1-based  
One edge per line with whitespace between nodes  

```
1 32
1 22
1 20
1 18
1 14
1 13
1 12
1 11
1 9
1 8
...
```

## Example of clustering file

Clusters can be 0-based or 1-based  
Clusters: one value per line in the numerical order of the nodes  

```
1
1
1
1
0
0
0
1
3

...
```
## Example of embedding file

Same format as with node2vec embedding:  
line 1:   #nodes dimension(d)   
lines 2+: node d-long_embedding_vector  

Nodes are 0-based or 1-based in any order
